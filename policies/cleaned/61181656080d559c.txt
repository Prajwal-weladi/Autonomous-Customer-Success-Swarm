Flipkart shall not be responsible for processing of such orders, and you agree that such situations do not amount to a deficiency in services of the website. Further, the Professional is also entitled under law to determine the medium of such Consultation Services, whether through text, audio or video media, in which case you provide your explicit consent to receive the Consultation Services through the medium determined by Professional, failing which the Professional has the right to refuse the Consultation Services.

What all is allowed in Flipkart Ratings and Reviews • Product Ratings • Product Reviews • Aspect Ratings (Rating for Battery, Camera etc.) • Image Reviews • Video Reviews Only Buyers with Verified Purchases can leave reviews: • Ratings & Reviews are solicited from users post-delivery of their product. • This happens across multiple touch points - both inside the Flipkart App (Notifications, Home Page, My Orders, Order Details) and outside the App (Email, SMSs, PNs) • In case someone who has not purchased a particular product on Flipkart, attempts to review/rate a product on Flipkart, we do not allow it under any circumstances. These users see an error. Crowd-sourced Review Feedback • We allow users to give Thumbs-up & Thumbs-down against every review. This is used in calculation of Wilson Score that is one of the factors in the ranking the reviews • Flag as abusive: Users are allowed to flag reviews as abusive in case they find content that they find as abusive. These are then manually moderated and taken down in case they violate any guidelines. Moderation of Reviews Auto-moderation (Algorithmic pipeline) Flipkart does auto-moderation of text reviews via an algorithmic pipeline. We check for the below and remove the reviews in case they breach one of the below conditions. • Text: Profanity, Personal or sensitive information, Religious and political comments , Emojis, Other mixed languages (detection and rejection), Competitor/Competitive Brand mentions (ex. Mentioning Brand B in a review of Brand A’s products), Price/Offer related information, URLs for external websites, Service related reviews for the product, Seller-attributable R&R such as fake, duplicate product will now be shown for single-seller listings, Future plan for multi-seller listings, Poorly formatted content, Irrelevant content • Image & Video: All images are manually moderated. Only images & videos that have completed moderation go live on the platform and are visible to other users. Manual moderation If the auto-moderation model is not confident enough (above a threshold) to categorize the text review in any of the categories, then it sends for manual moderation. All profane reviews go for manual moderation, even when auto-moderation model is able to categorize them. Image & Video components directly go for manual moderation. Text Reviews can be rejected for the following reasons: Profanity, Spam/HTML, Irrelevant Content, Price/Offer Related Content, Misleading joke review, Unintelligible Text/Very Bad Formatting, Product Related Query, Fake/Duplicate Product, Seller-attributable R&R such as fake, Future plan for multi-seller listings, Contains Personal Information, Rating & Review Mismatch (ex.

Profile based checks a) If a buyer has been blacklisted by Flipkart Trust & Safety Systems for one or more frauds and the customer has remained blacklisted for more than 30 days (accounting for false positives), then the Ratings and Reviews given by the user are not reliable, and are taken down. b) If a buyer is linked to a seller and the seller has been blacklisted by TnS for selling fake products or doing SPF fraud, then the Ratings and Reviews given by the buyer are not reliable and are taken down. c) If a buyer is linked to a seller and is giving good ratings (4 star or 5 star) to the seller's products, then such ratings are be marked as spam and taken down. d) If buyer is linked to a seller and is giving bad ratings (1 star, 2 star) to products sold by other sellers in the same vertical, then the ratings are marked as spam and taken down. 5. If a buyer has returned the product with return reason set which signifies dissatisfaction with the product and is still giving 4 star and 5 star rating, then the rating is marked as spam and taken down. e) If majority of a buyer's ratings are 1 stars (> 48% - number was arrived at by using outlier detection techniques) and > 50% of such 1 star ratings are anomalies, then the buyer is not reliable, and their ratings are taken down. Anomaly definition: if (average rating - 2\standard deviation > 1). f) If majority of a buyer's ratings are 5 stars (> 75% - number was arrived at by using outlier detection techniques) and > 50% of such 5 star ratings are anomalies, then the buyer is not reliable. Anomaly definition: if (average rating + 2\standard deviation <5) Model / algorithm we use for reviews Rating of a product is the plain average of all valid ratings that have been received by the product since the very first rating it received.
